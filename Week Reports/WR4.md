## Basic terminology
* **File system:** The way files are stored and organized.
  
* **Current directory:** The directory in which you are in at that moment.
  
* **parent directory:** The directory above another directory.
  
* **the difference between your home directory and the home directory:** The home directory stores all the users home directories. Your home directory has your personal files.

* **pathname:** Indicates the location of the file in the filesystem.
  
* **relative path:** The location of a file starting from the current working directory or a directory that is located inside the current working directory.
  
* **absolute path:** The location of the file starting at the root of the file system.
